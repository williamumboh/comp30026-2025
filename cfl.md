# Context-Free Languages

We are now going to consider context-free grammars (CFGs) and pushdown
automata (PDA). These are more powerful versions of regular expressions
and finite automata, respectively, and define a class of languages
called *context-free languages* that includes the canonical non-regular
language $\{0^n1^n \mid n \geq 0\}$.
