# Closure Properties

::: {prf:theorem label=thm-cfl-closure} Closure properties of CFLs

The class of context-free languages is closed under:

- union
- concatenation
- Kleene closure
- reversal

It is not closed under intersection. However, if $A$ is context-free and
$R$ is regular, then $A \cap R$ is context-free.
